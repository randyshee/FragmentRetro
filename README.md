## Overview

FragmentRetro is a fragment-based retrosynthetic method with quadratic complexity, offering a scalable alternative to tree search and [DirectMultiStep](https://github.com/batistagroup/DirectMultiStep/tree/main). The preprint for this work was posted on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15409).
